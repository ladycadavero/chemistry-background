Hi,

I'm Lady Shernalyn Cadavero, an MS in Chemistry student, and welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am upskilling my career in Data Analytics because of several skills I already have in Chemistry. Being in the Chemistry field had some similarities to Data Analytics, where the analyst identified trends, analysis of data after experimentation, data cleaning, applying statistics to support conclusions, and storytelling for the project flow following recommendations in optimizing processes. Data analytics has extensive industries like healthcare, finance, and technology. 

I am considered a career shifter because of the tools in Data Analytics such as SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Python, and so on; unlike in Chemistry, we use several Analytical Instruments such as HPLC, GC, GC-MS, AAS, UV-VIS, FTIR, and other spectroscopy and chromatography. I enjoyed working in the lab but felt more interested and willing to learn the IT field. At first, I studied HTML and CSS; however, starting to learn Web or Mobile Development is much more complex because of the field I am currently with, unlike choosing Data Analytics, where I am more familiar with other skills such as identification, decision making, interpretation, statistics and making the data have sense. It is easy to interpret data if you follow your objective, and if you are successful in this field, it helps the organization make decisions and succeed. 

Currently, I am self-studying for Data Analytics tools.
